# DrawingMap

Minecraft plugin adds:  
* Small scale maps (8:1, 4:1, 2:1)  
* Drawing maps  

Both map types have vanilla integration, such as full support for cartographer tables.

<b>Drawing maps</b>  
A player can choose the map render direction and scale by rotating the camera. The drawing map will render 4 planes in front of the player position:  
* The further the block, the darker it is
* If there are no blocks, the pixel will be transparent
